• A prototype model to generate electricity using a fan's rotational motion. A 200 RPM gear motor
converts the turbine's movement into electrical energy, producing up to 16V. This setup demonstrates
a simple and efficient method of sustainable power generation.• A prototype model to generate electricity using a fan's rotational motion. A 200 RPM gear motor
